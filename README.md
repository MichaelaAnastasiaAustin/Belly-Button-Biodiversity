# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Background

The basis of this assignment was to create engaging, dynamic charts so that biological researcher Roza and start-up company Improbable Beef find a bacterial species that has the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef.


## Overview

We have been tasked with completing four technical analysis deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

## Resources

- Data source: [samples.json](https://github.com/MichaelaAnastasiaAustin/Belly-Button-Biodiversity/blob/main/samples.json) 

- Software: HTML, Plotly, Bootstrap, CSS, Visual Studio Code

## Results

Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
- We successfully  created a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. 

Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
- We successfully created a bubble chart that displays the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage: the otu_ids as the x-axis values, the sample_values as the y-axis values, the sample_values as the marker size, the otu_ids as the marker colors, and the otu_labels as the hover-text values.

Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
- We successfully created a gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and display the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.

Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
- Finally, we customized the dashboard by 1) adding a background image to the jumbotron, 2) adding a background color to the webpage, and 3) adding a custom font color using the "!important" rule, so that the header text was more readable.



## Summary
The customized dashboard can be accessed at: https://michaelaanastasiaaustin.github.io/Belly-Button-Biodiversity/ 

When the webpage loads, you can select a "Test Subject ID No." Then, the webpage will automatically refresh and each chart will show data aligning with the new sample is selected. See images below for example:

All in all, we successfully visualized bacteria data for Roza and Improbable Beef. Furthermore, volunteers for the project are now able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
